# IntroDeepLearning

This repository contains lab assignments and solutions for the Intro to Deep Learning (CSC6851) course at Georgia State University, part of my Masters program. Each lab demonstrates foundational concepts and practical implementations in deep learning.

## Contents

- `lab1/`: Introduction to PyTorch and basic neural networks.
- `lab2/`: Advanced neural network architectures and training techniques.
- `lab3/`: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pooling strategies, regularization techniques, and optimizer comparisons on the MNIST dataset.
